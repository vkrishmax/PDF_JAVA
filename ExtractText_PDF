Extract Text From PDF Java

Using Apache PDFBox library, we can extract text/strings from a pdf file. In this example, we extract text from a pdf file named "test.pdf". We create a maven based project and add Apache PDFBox library dependency in the pom.xml file. 

<dependency>
     <groupId>org.apache.pdfbox</groupId>
     <artifactId>pdfbox</artifactId>
     <version>1.8.9</version>
 </dependency>
Write the following code in the "ReadPdfText.java" class.


package com.example.Pdf;

import org.apache.pdfbox.pdmodel.PDDocument;
import org.apache.pdfbox.util.PDFTextStripper;

import java.io.IOException;

public class ReadPdfText {
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        try {
            //load the pdf document
            PDDocument pdDocument=PDDocument.load("test.pdf");
            //count total pages
            int totalPages= pdDocument.getNumberOfPages();
            //print out total page numbers
            System.out.println("Total pages: " +totalPages);
            //define a PDF file stripper object
            PDFTextStripper stripper = new PDFTextStripper();
            //set start page to 1
            stripper.setStartPage( 1 );
            //set end page to total pages
            stripper.setEndPage( totalPages );
          String extractedText= stripper.getText(pdDocument);
            System.out.println(extractedText);
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}

Run the code above and see the result below .
